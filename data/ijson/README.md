# Estimating the number of Immortal Mutants for IJSON [IJSON](https://github.com/isagalaev/ijson)

The directory for experiments is `ijson/test/`

## User tests

We had `7`  user tests

Coverage obtained by user tests:

```
Name                                                                            Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing

originals/ijson.py                                                              140      0   100%
```

Mutation results from user tests:

Number of mutants produced: 274
Killed by user tests: 210
Survived: 35
Aborted (did not compile -- subtract from total population): 21
Timeout (add to killed): 8


# Unit Tests

These are *unit* tests which are generated by splitting each developer test case
into units. For example, the test_float test checks 11 individual floats encoded
in JSON as a single test in User tests. This is split into 11 different tests in
Unit Tests.

**TODO**


## Fuzz tests

**TODO**


Immortals by manual inspection: 7
```
cat ijson/test/plog/mutate.current.log  | grep -- '-survived' | wc -l
```
Mortals by manual inspection on those that survived: 28
```
cat ijson/test/plog/mutate.current.log  | grep -- '+survived' | wc -l
```

## Data Files

This directory contains three matrix files. They are of this format: mutants as
rows and tests as columns. A test that killed a mutant is marked as 1 and
that did not kill is marked as 0
